  "confusion_points": [
    "Apple is transitioning to USB-C - iPhone 15 and newer use USB-C, not Lightning",

    "Data transfer is limited to USB 2.0 speeds (480 Mbps) for most use cases",
    "Maximum charging is 12W - significantly slower than USB-C Power Delivery"
  ],
  "buying_guide": "For Lightning cables, always look for MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad) certification - uncertified cables may be blocked by iOS updates or damage your device. Apple and certified third-party brands like Anker, Belkin, and Mophie are safe choices. If you have an iPhone 15 or newer, you need USB-C, not Lightning.",
  "notes": "Lightning was introduced by Apple in 2012 as a proprietary replacement for the 30-pin dock connector. It was revolutionary for being reversible and compact, predating USB-C by several years. However, Apple has begun transitioning to USB-C starting with iPhone 15 in 2023, following EU regulations requiring a common charging standard. Lightning will remain relevant for older Apple devices for years to come, but new purchases should consider USB-C compatibility.",
